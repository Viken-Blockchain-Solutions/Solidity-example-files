# Introduction

Context:

_We wanted to develop and deploy a smart contract that would allow us to incentivize and reward our community, for being long-term token HODLER, contributing to our community, and supporting our project._

_We decided that Staking would be the safest and best solution to reach our goal, to distribute rewards among those who want to stake their tokens with us long-term._

_TicketVault is a custom developed smart-contract for single ERC20 staking and rewards distribution._

_With this documentation, we will give you an in-depth description of the features in this smart contract._
